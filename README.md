# Romanian language embeddings debiasing #

Given the growing concern about the negative impact that gender-biased language embeddings may have in practical applications, we measure the gender bias in existing Romanian language embeddings using the method proposed in <a id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</a> for languages with grammatical gender, and invite contributors to submit debiasing methods that can lower the gender bias in existing embeddings, or submit less biased embeddings.

- The experiment was adapted from the [original](https://github.com/shaoxia57/Bias_in_Gendered_Languages) experiment for Romanian language.
- All the credits for adapting and running the experiments goes to Beata Lorincz.
